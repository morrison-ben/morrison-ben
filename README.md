### Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹ 


*A couple of things about me:*


- I have a passion for software development. I genuinely enjoy it and see it as more than just a "career choice".
- At work I write backend code using C++. I also help customers find solutions for their needs through the use of our API.
- Outside of work, I often write code in Python. I've messed around with web scraping a bit. I enjoy working with databases and building MERN stack web applications.

*What I'm working on:*


I've spent the last year or so designing and building a website with a lifelong friend. It's a social media site centered around the world of sports betting.
We kicked off an alpha release right in time for the start of March Madness, and received lots of helpful feedback from our users on the improvements that could be made
prior to the eventual beta release. The biggest piece of feedback we received is the need for a mobile app...although the current website is mobile-friendly,
the presence of mobile notifications delivered directly to your phone/tablet would greatly increase the desire for users to engage with the app on a regular basis.
We are now looking into the creation of a mobile app as part of the beta release. I've never developed a mobile app before, so that's what I am currently learning
about in my spare time.
